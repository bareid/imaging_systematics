      "If I understand correctly, we are integrating over all the pixels(i.e. taking continuous limit of double sum over i,j) so I am not too sure why the output is denoted as x whereas the input is y ,instead of a doule integral $\\int \\int ...dx dy$ and how this relates to the R variable in de Vauc formula:\n",

      "I read up on how to do this kind of integral, I need to substitue $\\chi$=(x-y), square the whole integral, since it is the same form, you can also subsitute another vairable $\\Upsilon$ , using the relation $r^2=\\chi^2+\\Upsilon^2$ to convert to polar where you get an extra r with $ dr d\\theta$ which makes the integral possible to solve. The rest should be just algebra."
